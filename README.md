# NLibsndfile

[Libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) is an excellent multi-format audio processing library written in C. The goal of NLibsndfile is to provide .NET developers with access to Libsndfile through a friendly programming interface.

NLibsndfile's API was designed to fit two main goals.

* Ease of use for existing Libsndfile developers by providing direct API access.
* Ease of use for existing .NET developers by providing a Stream based API compliant with .NET BCL standards.
